/*Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. 
No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
Example 1:
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true

Explanation:
The strings s and t can be made identical by:
Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
Mapping 'g' to 'd'.

Example 2:
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false

Explanation:
The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.

Example 3:
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
t.length == s.length
s and t consist of any valid ascii character.*/

/* Explanation:

Two HashMaps:
mapST stores the mapping from characters in s to t.
mapTS stores the reverse mapping from characters in t to s.
Check consistency:

Before adding a new mapping, ensure that existing mappings are consistent.
If s[i] maps to something different in t or vice versa, return false.
Efficiency:

Time complexity: 
𝑂(𝑛)
O(n), where 𝑛 is the length of the strings.
Space complexity: 
𝑂(1)
O(1), since the map can only store up to 256 entries (character mappings).*/
